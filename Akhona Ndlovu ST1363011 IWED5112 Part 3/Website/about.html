        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2018, Urban Coffee Hub started with a simple dream: to create the most delightful coffee using the finestbrewed ingredients. Over the years, we have grown from a small local coffee shop into a beloved institution, known for our passion for quality and creativity.</p>
        <p>Our founder, Akhona, started making coffee as a hobby in her home kitchen. What began as a passion project quickly turned into a thriving business as word spread about her delicious coffee. Today, we continue to uphold her commitment to excellence in every bite.</p>
